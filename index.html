		<h1>HTML Day 1</h1>
		<hr />
		<h2>Difference between div and span?</h2>
		<p>
			Both the tags <strong>(< div > and < span >)</strong> are used to
			represent the part of the webpage, < div > tag is used as a block part of
			the webpage and < span > tag is used as a inline part of the webpage.
		</p>
		<p>
			The div tag is known as Division tag, used to make divisions of content on
			the web page like (text, images, header, footer, navigation bar, etc).
		</p>
		<p>
			The span element is a generic inline container for inline elements and
			content. It used to group elements for styling purposes (by using the
			class or id attributes).
		</p>

		<h2>Difference between class and IDs?</h2>
		<p>
			The id attribute is a unique identifier that is used to specify the
			document.
		</p>
		<p>
			The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can
			only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to
			multiple elements.
		</p>
		<h2>What are self closing tags?</h2>
		<p>
			A self closing tags in HTML are the type of HTML tags that need to be
			closed manually by its closing tag, which means there is no separate
			closing tag for it as < / tag >.
		</p>
		<em>Example:</em>
		<p>< / img >, < input / >, < br / >, < hr / >, etc.</p>
		<p>also known as empty tags, void tags, singletons tags, etc</p>
		<h2>
			How many types of headings are there? How to decide which to use where?
		</h2>
		<p>Six levels of headings.</p>
		<p>
			HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a
			webpage.
		</p>
		<p>
			H2 This is a top level heading. heading element implies all the font
			changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary
			to render the heading.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				h1 tag you should when you want to give the main heading of the page.
			</li>
			<li>h2 h3 tags you should use to give the sub-headings in the page.</li>
			<li>h4 h5 h6 tags you should use to give the content.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Difference between block and inline?</h2>
		<p>
			Block elements: They consume the entire width available irrespective of
			their sufficiency. They always start in a new line and have top and bottom
			margins. It does not contain any other elements next to it.
		</p>
		<em>Example:</em>
		<p>< div >, < p >, < h1 > to < h6 >, < table > and < form >, etc.</p>
		<p>
			Inline elements: Inline elements occupy only enough width that is
			sufficient to it and allows other elements next to it which are inline.
			Inline elements dont start from a new line and dont have top and bottom
			margins as block elements have.
		</p>
		<em>Example:</em>
		<p>< a >, < span >, < img >, < input >, < label >, etc.</p>
		<h2>Difference between em and strong?</h2>
		<p>
			The strong tag is used to define text with strong importance. The content
			inside is typically displayed in bold.
		</p>
		<p>
			The em tag is used to define emphasized text. The content inside is
			typically displayed in italic. A screen reader will pronounce the words in
			em with an emphasis, using verbal stress.
		</p>
		<h2>What are attributes?</h2>
		<p>
			Attributes are special words which provide additional information about
			the elements and are the modifiers of HTML elements
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>All HTML elements can have attributes</li>
			<li>Attributes provide additional information about elements</li>
			<li>Attributes are always specified in the start tag.</li>
			<li>Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Difference between HTML tags and elements?</h2>
		<p>
			HTML Tags: Tags are the starting and ending parts of an HTML element. They
			begin with < symbol and end with > symbol. Whatever written inside < and >
			are called tags.
		</p>
		<p>
			HTML elements: Elements enclose the contents in between the tags. They
			consist of some kind of structure or expression. It generally consists of
			a start tag, content and an end tag.
